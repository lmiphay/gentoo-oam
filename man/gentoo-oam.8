.SH NAME
gentoo-oam \- workflow helpers for a gentoo server

.SH SYNOPSIS

oam-fetch \- fetch package sources prior to compilation/installation

oam-genlop \- wrapper around genlop

oam-glsa \- wrapper around glsa-check

oam-qcheck \- runs qcheck and produces a summary of files with potential problems

oam-kernel \- configure, build and install a new kernel

oam-sync \- run a set of sync actions

oam-unmask-write \- run an emerge update operation with --autounmask-write set to 'y'

oam-update \- run a normal set of emerge update actions

oam-uptime \- writes a short system loadavg to the console

oam-version \- write the gentoo-oam version to the console

.SH DESCRIPTION
gentoo-oam builds on portage utilities to automate some common
task sequences (referred to here as workflows).
The individual tasks delegate most of the work to portage tools.
.P
.IP \(bu
Common tasks are automated (e.g. weekly update, overlays sync... etc)
.IP \(bu
Everything is logged (under /var/log/oam), and logrotate'd.
.IP \(bu
Overview of actions provided by oam-watch
.IP \(bu
Central configuration is taken from /etc/gentoo-oam.conf
.IP \(bu
The package also acts as a meta package pulling in some very useful portage
utilities (e.g. eix, glsa-check... etc)
.P
An example action list: 
.PP
.RS 0
        oam-sync
.RS 0
        oam-glsa
.RS 0
        oam-fetch
.RS 0
        oam-update
.RS 0
        oam-qcheck

.SH QUICKSTART

Starting from scratch:
.IP \(bu
Examine /etc/gentoo-oam.conf for anything that you need to localise on your server
.IP \(bu
As root run:
.B
oam-flow weekly
.IP \(bu
In another console run:
.B
oam-watch
.P

.SH COMPONENTS

.P
.B oam-flow <flowname>
runs the tasks in OAM_FLOW from: /etc/gentoo-oam.d/<flowname>.conf
.P

.B oam-sync
runs these actions in sequence:
.RS
.P
.IP \(bu
emaint --auto sync
.IP \(bu
layman --sync=ALL (only if layman is installed)
.IP \(bu
eix-update
.IP \(bu
eix-remote update1 (only if layman is installed - disable by setting OAM_EIX_REMOTE=0)
.IP \(bu
eix-remote add1 (only if layman is installed - disable by setting OAM_EIX_REMOTE=0)
.IP \(bu
oam-summary (to summarise the merges/blocks/news items in the update)
.RE
.P
The eix actions will only run every OAM_EIX_REMOTE_DAYS days - by default they will not
run more than once every 6 days to avoid hammering zugaina.
.P
.B oam-glsa
runs glsa-check, logging the results to /var/log/oam/DATE/glsa.log.
Will return 7 if that file is non-empty, 0 otherwise. Returning 7 means that
the workflow will continue processing the remaining tasks.
.P

.B oam-fetch
runs
.B
"emerge --fetchonly"
to pull down source packages prior to the merge step.
.P

.B oam-update
runs these actions in sequence:
.RS
.P
.IP \(bu
emerge world
.IP \(bu
revdep-rebuild
.IP \(bu
python-updater
.IP \(bu
perl-cleaner (if it is installed)
.IP \(bu
emerge @preserved-rebuild (if there are preserved libraries)
.IP \(bu
eclean distfiles (if the OAM_CLEAN_DISTFILES setting is 1)
.RE
.P

.B oam-qcheck
runs qcheck(1), saving all AFK and MD5-DIGEST failures to a summary file

.B oam-unmask-write
runs oam-fetch with '--autounmask-write y' set.

.B oam-genlop
is a wrapper called by oam-watch to filter the output of 'genlop -c'. See
man genlop(1) / FEATURES if there never seems to be a merge running.

.B oam-version
prints the version of the gentoo-oam to stdout.
.P

.B oam-kernel
is a new kernel manager - it will:
.RS
.IP \(bu
attempt to locate, install, configure and backup .config files
.IP \(bu
build the kernel, modules and rebuild external third party modules
.IP \(bu
optionally install the new kernel
.RE
.P
Note that oam-kernel requires that /usr/src/linux be symlinked to the latest kernel version (e.g.
in the case of gentoo-sources it DEPENDS on: gentoo-sources[symlink] or
sys-kernel/aufs-sources[symlink]... etc).
.P
It will not compile a kernel if any of these conditions are true:
.RS
.IP \(bu
if the kernel version at /usr/src/linux is found installed under /lib/modules
.IP \(bu
if /usr/src/linux/vmlinux exists
.RE
.P
If a .config file is not present under /usr/src/linux, the oam-kernel will attempt to
locate one, checking for files in this order:
.RS
.IP \(bu
/usr/src/linux-$(uname -r)/.config
.IP \(bu
/proc/config.gz
.IP \(bu
/boot/config-$(uname -r)
.IP \(bu
from the oam-kernel maintained git repository at /usr/src/kernel-config.git
.RE
.P
The script will then:
.RS
.IP \(bu
run make -C /usr/src/linux olddefconfig
.IP \(bu
back up the resulting .config to the git repo at /usr/src/kernel-config.git
.IP \(bu
run make -C /usr/src/linux all modules_install
.IP \(bu
oam-merge @module-rebuild
.RE
.P
The resulting kernel will not be automatically installed. This behavior is controlled by
the 
.I
OAM_KERNEL_INSTALL
variable - setting this to 1 will trigger the install following a successful compilation.
.P
Manually running
.I
"oam-kernel install"
will attempt to install the kernel.
.P
.B
Currently the only installation method supported is via efibootmgr(8).

.SH SYSTEM SETTINGS

These settings control the operation of gentoo-oam and are set in /etc/gentoo-oam.conf:
.TP
.BI OAM_EMERGE_OPTS
The parameters passed to emerge for update. See /etc/gentoo-oam.conf for default settings.
.TP
.BI OAM_EMERGE_SYNC
Used to decide if emerge --sync should be run (for example you may not want to
run it if the /usr/portage/distfiles is nfs mounted from another server).
Defaults to 1
.TP
.BI OAM_CLEAN_DISTFILES
Used to decide if eclean distfiles should be run (for example you may not want to
run it if the /usr/portage/distfiles is nfs mounted from another server). Defaults to 1
.TP
.BI OAM_FLOW
The actions to perform when "oam-flow <flowname>" is run. See /etc/gentoo-oam.conf for default settings.
.TP
.BI OAM_ONERROR
When a workflow fails, the program given by this setting will be called with three parameters:
.RS
.IP \(bu 
The name of the workflow script that failed
.IP \(bu
The task belonging to the workflow that failed (e.g. oam-update)
.IP \(bu
The return value from the failed task (e.g. 1)
.P
A workflow is deemed to fail when the return code from any of the tasks is not zero.
If the return code result from the
.I
task or the handler process
is
.I
7
then the workflow will be continued at the next task - if the handler process
returns any other value, then the workflow will be terminated.
.RE
.TP
.BI OAM_LOGDIR
The location where gentoo-oam logs will be sent/stored. Defaults to /var/log/oam
.TP
.BI OAM_TS
The date/time format used by gentoo-oam for logging. Defaults to "%Y%m%d:%H:%M:%S"
.TP
.BI OAM_HEARTBEATSLEEP
How long to sleep between printing out the load average and gelop(1) output. Defaults to 60 (seconds).
.TP
.BI OAM_SANDBOXWAIT
How long to wait for the sandbox process to appear before trying to run genlop(1).
.TP
.BI DISPLAY
DISPLAY should be set appropriately if the configured editor needs X11.

.SH WORKFLOW

As an example, to add a new "local" workflow:
.TP
.BI /etc/gentoo-oam.d/local.conf
Add the required steps to a new OAM_FLOW variable defined in: /etc/gentoo-oam.d/local.conf
Other settings which need to be specific to this new workflow can be added to this newly created
configuration file and they will override the system settings found in /etc/gentoo-oam.conf
For example a workflow specific OAM_ONERROR handler can be defined for the new workflow here as
well.
.P
Non gentoo-oam steps can be added to the new workflow provided that:
.IP \(bu
The step can be executed as a program such as:
e.g. "/usr/local/bin/localbackup.sh"
.IP \(bu
The step should ideally its own logging - gentoo-oam will capture output
to /var/oam/local.log (in the case of the example).
.IP \(bu
The step should return 0 to indicate that the action succeeded. If it returns a
non-zero result then the workflow will be aborted at that point (and the on error
handler called if one has been defined).

.P
Example: in /etc/gentoo-oam.d/local.conf (note dummy scripts for illustration purposes):
